      <h2>First Process Documentation</h2>
      <p>
        This week our group focused on forming teams and defining the direction of our project.
        After some discussion, we decided to create a video game that brings elements of party communication and social interaction into an online space. 
        We wanted something that emphasizes fun, collaboration, and conversation among players, similar to the experience of party games but accessible digitally. 
        At this stage, we also began thinking about what information we needed to gather for the empathize step of the design thinking process. 
        We discussed how people usually socialize, what makes party games enjoyable, and which dynamics we would want to carry into our online game. 
        Overall, it was a week of aligning our goals, clarifying expectations, and setting the foundation for the project.

      <h2>Second Process Documentation</h2>
      <p>
        In week two, we conducted a playtest to better understand how people socialize during games and what aspects we should consider when developing our design. 
        From the session, we noticed several key elements: people enjoyed making accusations based on movement, sounds, or strategic positioning; excitement built up after each voting round; and players asked many questions during the voting sessions. 
        Clear role explanations were important, as well as limiting discussion time to keep energy high. 
        We also saw how laughter and humor played a big role in making the experience fun, and we discussed how to replicate this “laughter effect” in an online version. 
        Another highlight was how having a game master added to the fun and structure of the experience. 
        Although we faced a setback this week when two of our team members left, we adjusted our scope and moved forward with the project. Despite the challenges, the playtest gave us valuable insights that will guide our next steps.

      <h2>Third Process Documentation</h2>
      <p>
        This week we moved into the Define stage, using the observations and feedback we gathered from players to shape the direction of our project. 
        Our main focus was identifying how to recreate the feelings of laughter, spontaneity, and shared fun that emerged during play sessions. 
        We want the game to feel like a true virtual party, where emotions and chaos naturally spark between players.

        At the same time, we began to map the scope of our idea within Discord Activities, considering how our mechanics could be adapted to this platform. 
        This meant starting to outline what is technically feasible while keeping the playful atmosphere at the core. 
        The balance between emotional design and platform constraints is now guiding how we refine our concept moving forward.

      <h2>Fourth Process Documentation</h2>
      <p>
        This week, we focused on getting the Discord Activity to function properly as the foundation for our game. 
        We successfully set up the basic activity, which now displays “Hello, world” and the server name when launched. 
        This was an important milestone since it confirmed that our app can run directly inside Discord and communicate with the server environment as expected. 
        We also configured the setup so that both team members can work on it collaboratively, ensuring that changes and tests can be done from each person’s side without conflicts.

        Alongside the technical setup, we continued ideating the game’s theme and narrative sequence. 
        We discussed potential directions and refined our concept to find one that fits the mechanics of a social deduction game while keeping the visuals manageable. 
        These brainstorming sessions are helping us align the story, roles, and atmosphere with the core gameplay flow we’re envisioning for the final project.

      <h2>Fifth Process Documentation</h2>
      <p>
        This week felt like a big step forward in getting the game to actually feel alive. 
        We spent most of our time figuring out how to make everything connect properly, so getting the multi-connectivity working so that players could finally join and move around together.
        We also worked a lot on the game flow, making sure the transitions between the lobby, arena, and podium made sense and felt smooth.
        It’s starting to feel like an actual experience now, not just a collection of separate screens.

        Visually, we fixed a few things that were bothering us, like the floor and wall materials not showing up correctly. 
        After some debugging and tweaking the imports, they finally render properly, which makes the whole environment look more grounded. 
        We also got the character movement to behave better. 
        Now everyone can move independently, and it syncs across players. 
        Even though there’s still a lot left to polish, it’s exciting to see the game’s base structure taking shape and functioning as it should.

      <h2>Sixth Process Documentation</h2>
      <p>
       This week was about giving more life and personality to the game. 
       I added several new roles: the Witch, Seer, Cupid, Hunter, and Lovers.
       This makes each round feels a bit more dynamic depending on how many people are playing. 
       It makes the gameplay feel richer, even though we still need more people to properly test all the interactions.

       The killing system now works, and the Seer’s ability was functioning at one point (though it mysteriously stopped showing up later, so that’s on my list to fix). 
       I also spent time organizing and commenting the code so it’s easier to navigate and make sense of later.
       Right now, I’m thinking about how to frame the discussion state (what happens in that moment when everyone talks and decides who to vote out). 
       It’s such an important part of the atmosphere, and I want it to feel right. 
       The win conditions are implemented this way: either the werewolves are all gone, or they outnumber the others. 

       There’s still a bit of lag when the voting starts, which might just be because I’m testing with multiple tabs open on my computer. 
       But even with those small issues, it feels rewarding to see how far it’s come. 
       The structure is clearer, the roles are functional, and it’s finally starting to feel like we planned at the beginning at least concept wise.
