      <h2>Week 1</h2>
      <p>
        This week our group focused on forming teams and defining the direction of our project.
        After some discussion, we decided to create a video game that brings elements of party communication and social interaction into an online space. 
        We wanted something that emphasizes fun, collaboration, and conversation among players, similar to the experience of party games but accessible digitally. 
        At this stage, we also began thinking about what information we needed to gather for the empathize step of the design thinking process. 
        We discussed how people usually socialize, what makes party games enjoyable, and which dynamics we would want to carry into our online game. 
        Overall, it was a week of aligning our goals, clarifying expectations, and setting the foundation for the project.

      <h2>Week 2</h2>
      <p>
        In week two, we conducted a playtest to better understand how people socialize during games and what aspects we should consider when developing our design. 
        From the session, we noticed several key elements: people enjoyed making accusations based on movement, sounds, or strategic positioning; excitement built up after each voting round; and players asked many questions during the voting sessions. 
        Clear role explanations were important, as well as limiting discussion time to keep energy high. 
        We also saw how laughter and humor played a big role in making the experience fun, and we discussed how to replicate this “laughter effect” in an online version. 
        Another highlight was how having a game master added to the fun and structure of the experience. 
        Although we faced a setback this week when two of our team members left, we adjusted our scope and moved forward with the project. Despite the challenges, the playtest gave us valuable insights that will guide our next steps.
