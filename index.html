      <h2>Week 1</h2>
      <p>
        This week our group focused on forming teams and defining the direction of our project.
        After some discussion, we decided to create a video game that brings elements of party communication and social interaction into an online space. 
        We wanted something that emphasizes fun, collaboration, and conversation among players, similar to the experience of party games but accessible digitally. 
        At this stage, we also began thinking about what information we needed to gather for the empathize step of the design thinking process. 
        We discussed how people usually socialize, what makes party games enjoyable, and which dynamics we would want to carry into our online game. 
        Overall, it was a week of aligning our goals, clarifying expectations, and setting the foundation for the project.

      <h2>Week 2</h2>
      <p>
        In week two, we conducted a playtest to better understand how people socialize during games and what aspects we should consider when developing our design. 
        From the session, we noticed several key elements: people enjoyed making accusations based on movement, sounds, or strategic positioning; excitement built up after each voting round; and players asked many questions during the voting sessions. 
        Clear role explanations were important, as well as limiting discussion time to keep energy high. 
        We also saw how laughter and humor played a big role in making the experience fun, and we discussed how to replicate this “laughter effect” in an online version. 
        Another highlight was how having a game master added to the fun and structure of the experience. 
        Although we faced a setback this week when two of our team members left, we adjusted our scope and moved forward with the project. Despite the challenges, the playtest gave us valuable insights that will guide our next steps.

      <h2>Week 3</h2>
      <p>
        This week we moved into the Define stage, using the observations and feedback we gathered from players to shape the direction of our project. 
        Our main focus was identifying how to recreate the feelings of laughter, spontaneity, and shared fun that emerged during play sessions. 
        We want the game to feel like a true virtual party, where emotions and chaos naturally spark between players.

        At the same time, we began to map the scope of our idea within Discord Activities, considering how our mechanics could be adapted to this platform. 
        This meant starting to outline what is technically feasible while keeping the playful atmosphere at the core. 
        The balance between emotional design and platform constraints is now guiding how we refine our concept moving forward.

      <h2>Week 4</h2>
      <p>
        This week, we focused on getting the Discord Activity to function properly as the foundation for our game. 
        We successfully set up the basic activity, which now displays “Hello, world” and the server name when launched. 
        This was an important milestone since it confirmed that our app can run directly inside Discord and communicate with the server environment as expected. 
        We also configured the setup so that both team members can work on it collaboratively, ensuring that changes and tests can be done from each person’s side without conflicts.

        Alongside the technical setup, we continued ideating the game’s theme and narrative sequence. 
        We discussed potential directions and refined our concept to find one that fits the mechanics of a social deduction game while keeping the visuals manageable. 
        These brainstorming sessions are helping us align the story, roles, and atmosphere with the core gameplay flow we’re envisioning for the final project.
